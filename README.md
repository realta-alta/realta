# Hello there! I'm Realta Krasniqi.I recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, with a strong focus on Computer Graphics and Multimedia. This specialization allowed me to blend creativity with technology â€” something Iâ€™m truly passionate about.I love building digital experiences that are both functional and visually engaging. From designing interactive websites to experimenting with 2D/3D visuals and games, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code and design.
